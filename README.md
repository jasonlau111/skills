# My AI Skills Collection

This repository contains my personal collection of advanced AI skills and protocols, designed to enhance Agentic workflows.

## Skills

### [Deep Mode (Virtual Memory Injector)](deep-mode/README.md)
> **The Core Protocol**. A "System 2" thinking protocol that forces AI to simulate pressure, verify evidence, and self-reflect before answering. 
> Includes the "7-Stage Virtual Memory Script" and "Evidence First" methodology.

## Usage

To use these skills with your AI Agent (e.g. Gemini, Claude Code):
1. Copy the skill folder into your agent's skill directory (e.g. `~/.gemini/skills/`).
2. Trigger them using the keywords defined in each `SKILL.md`.
